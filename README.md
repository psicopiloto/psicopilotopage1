# Psicopiloto - Ready for Vercel (Next.js + Tailwind)

This project is prepared to be deployed on Vercel. **Important**: Vercel requires a `pages/` or `app/` directory at the repository root. This repo has `pages/` at the root.

## Quick checklist before deploying to Vercel
1. Extract the ZIP and make sure files like `package.json`, `pages/`, `components/` are at the project root (not nested inside another folder).
2. Initialize a Git repo and push to GitHub (instructions below) OR upload the project folder directly to a new GitHub repo (use the web UI 'Upload files' and upload the contents of the project root).
3. In Vercel, Import Project â†’ select the GitHub repo.
4. Add Environment Variables in Vercel (Project Settings > Environment Variables):
   - `FORMSPREE_URL` = https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_ENDPOINT (see Formspree setup)
   - `GAS_URL` = https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_ID/exec (see Google Apps Script setup)
5. Deploy. Vercel will run `npm install` and `npm run build` automatically.

## If you get the error "Couldn't find any `pages` or `app` directory"
This means your repo root doesn't contain the `pages/` folder. Common reasons:
- You zipped a parent folder (e.g. `psicopiloto_v2/psicopiloto/`) so GitHub/Vercel sees only that parent instead of the inner files.
- You uploaded the ZIP contents as a single top-level folder into GitHub. Fix: ensure files are at the root of the repo (package.json and pages/ should be top-level).

### How to check locally (macOS)
In Terminal, inside the project folder run:
```
ls -la
```
You should see `package.json` and a `pages` directory in the output.

## How to push to GitHub (simple steps)
1. Open Terminal and `cd` to the folder where you extracted the ZIP.
2. Run these commands (replace with your repo URL):
```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Psicopiloto site"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USER/YOUR_REPO.git
git push -u origin main
```
If you don't have git installed on your iMac, you can upload via GitHub web UI: create a new repo and use "Upload files" then drag & drop the project files (not the parent folder).

## Formspree setup (email)
1. Create account at https://formspree.io
2. Create a form and copy the endpoint (https://formspree.io/f/xxxxx)
3. Paste that URL in Vercel as `FORMSPREE_URL` (Environment Variables).

## Google Sheets (save submissions)
Follow the instructions in the original README included in the ZIP. The Apps Script `doPost` endpoint returns /exec URL to set as `GAS_URL` in Vercel.

## Notes
- You can leave `FORMSPREE_URL` and `GAS_URL` empty while deploying; the site will render fine, but the contact form will respond with an error message explaining the missing env vars.
- If Vercel build fails, check the build logs: they show `ls` of the repo root and the error messages.
